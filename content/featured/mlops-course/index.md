Having struggled with understanding how the mlops flow works, We (Katonic Team) made the course I wish I could have had.
Here I'm explaining the MLOps Level 2 which includes Feature Store (now deprec.) and Model Automation.

Unlike tutorials that only cover a few concepts and leave you with half-baked GitHub repositories, this course covers everything from explaining the principles of MLOps to implementing End-to-End ML Project lifecycle from data collection to model serving through REST API. By the end of the course, youâ€™ll have an model deployed to the internet you can add to your portfolio.
